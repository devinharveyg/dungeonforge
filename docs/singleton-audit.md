# The Singleton Audit — Lab 3, Part C

Below are **eight** candidate classes from DungeonForge's future. Three you have already met;
five arrive in Weeks 4 to 15. For each, decide: **Singleton, or not?**

Answer with the test we will use all semester:

> **Would a second instance be a BUG, or merely unusual?**
>
> If two instances would produce *incorrect behaviour* — not just wasted memory, not just
> inconvenience — the class may deserve to be a Singleton.
> If two instances would merely be *odd*, it is a dependency, and you should pass it in.

Fill in every row. Two of the eight are genuine singletons; you already know which, because
you built them this week. Your job is to defend the other six answers.

| # | Class | What it does | Singleton? | Would a 2nd instance be a bug, or just unusual? Why? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `GameConfig` | Holds every tunable setting |x| |
| 2 | `RandomSource` | The one seeded RNG |x| |
| 3 | `Player` | The player character | |x|
| 4 | `MonsterFactory` (Wk 4) | Turns blueprints into monsters | |x|
| 5 | `EventBus` (Wk 5) | Publishes game events to subscribers |x| |
| 6 | `CommandHistory` (Wk 7) | The undo stack | |x|
| 7 | `SaveSystemFacade` (Wk 12) | Reads and writes save files | |x|
| 8 | `Logger` | Writes diagnostic output to a file |x| |

## The three that will cause arguments

Rows 5, 7 and 8 are the interesting ones, and reasonable engineers disagree about all three.
Pick **one** of them and write a paragraph:

**Which one:** __8___

**The case FOR making it a Singleton:**
Making the Logger a singleton would help ensure there is only one place to log output to.
All logs would be unified to a single output.

**The case AGAINST:**
Avoiding the singleton pattern would allow for multiple different logs that save to unique output files.


**What you would actually do in this project, and why:**
I would start by using a singleton to make the initial logging implementation simpler.
The singleton getInstance method is easier to use because it will instantiate itself.

## One more question

Your `GameConfig` has a method called `resetForTests()`. It exists only so that tests can
undo the global state that the Singleton created.

**In one or two sentences: what is that method telling you about the pattern?**

The singleton pattern is destroyed by the reset method.
The resetForTests method breaks the singleton pattern because it is not meant to be instantiated more than once.
