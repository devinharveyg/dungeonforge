# Artifact Review Clinic — Lab 2, Part C

> **This is the only document you write this week.** Everything else — the epics, the
> stories, the acceptance criteria, the Definition of Done, the sprint plans — was written
> for you.
>
> Reading critically is a harder and more useful skill than writing from a blank page, and it
> is the one that will make your own stories good when you start writing them in Week 6.

Read all three before answering:
- `docs/backlog.md`
- `docs/definition-of-done.md`
- `docs/sprint-01-plan.md`

## C1 — Find the three planted flaws · 12 pts

There is **exactly one deliberate defect in each of the three documents**: one bad user
story, one unverifiable Definition-of-Done criterion, and one sprint-plan item that isn't
what it claims to be.

> **Hint for the story:** re-read INVEST first. The bad one fails more than one letter.
>
> **Hint for the DoD:** ask of every checkbox — *could two reasonable people disagree about
> whether this is true?* If yes, it isn't a criterion. It's an opinion.

### Flaw 1 — in `docs/backlog.md`

**Which item:**
backlog.md US-1.4

**What's wrong with it:**  
**Which INVEST letter(s) it violates, and how:**
N: This story is not negotiable
V: This is too subjective
T: This is too subjective to test


**My repaired version:**

Pick someone who will benefit in measurable terms.

```
As a ...,
I want ...,
so that ...

Acceptance Criteria
- Given ..., when ..., then ...
- Given ..., when ..., then ...
```

### Flaw 2 — in `docs/definition-of-done.md`

**Which checkbox:**  
- [ ] The code is well written and easy for someone else to understand

**Why it can't actually be checked:**
This checkbox is not measurable by a machine and based on opinion.

**My replacement, phrased so that it can be:**
- [ ] Every class has a comment to what it is used for


---

### Flaw 3 — in `docs/sprint-01-plan.md`

**Which item:**  
I might get busy this week

**Why it isn't really what the document calls it:**  
This is not a risk that can be overcome.  

**My repaired version, including a mitigation someone could actually act on:**  
Set actual deadlines.

## C2 — Say what's good, and why · 9 pts

Pick the **three strongest user stories** in `docs/backlog.md`. For each, two or three
sentences.

> Praise is harder than criticism, and it's where most of the learning is. "It's clear" earns
> nothing. "Its third criterion names an observable output — the same object reference — so
> two people would always agree whether it passed" earns full marks.

### Strong story 1: ______ S0.3 — The board shows the truth

**INVEST letters it satisfies especially well:**  
TESTABLE: This user story is easy to test and has well defined functionality.  

**What specifically makes its acceptance criteria checkable:**  
There is a easy way to check for the board matching the actual locations of things.

### Strong story 2: ______ US-1.2 — The same seed produces the same dungeon  

**INVEST letters it satisfies especially well:**  
TESTABLE: This user story is easy to test and can be checked by a machine.  

**What specifically makes its acceptance criteria checkable:**  
It is very easy to test for.  

### Strong story 3: ______ US-1.1 — Settings live in one place

**INVEST letters it satisfies especially well:**  
NEGOTIABLE: This story has simple asks that can implemented different ways.  

**What specifically makes its acceptance criteria checkable:**  
It is simple functionality that can be tested for by a machine.

## C3 — Trace a story to code · 4 pts

Take **US-1.1** (settings live in one place). **Write no Java.** In plain English, describe
what you'd expect to see in the pull-request diff when this story is done, and which
acceptance criterion each piece satisfies.

| What I'd expect in the diff | Which acceptance criterion it satisfies |
|---|---|
| Create the config.json file | AC#1 |
| Create a config class to save and load game variables | AC#3 |
| Create a main class  | AC#1 |
| Make sure the config has a getInstance method | AC#1 |

**One sentence: how did the acceptance criteria help you predict the shape of the work?**
The acceptance criteria lists the code and files required.

## C4 — The bonus catch · up to +3 bonus

Once you have dealt with the bad story, something in `docs/sprint-01-plan.md` no longer adds
up the way it did.

**What is it:**

**What a real team would do about it in sprint planning:**

**What this suggests about the relationship between vague work and over-committed sprints:**

## C5 — One honest question

What is one thing about the Scrum process you still don't understand after this week? A good
question here is worth more to me than a confident wrong answer.  
It seems like a lot of extra work to setup the sprints and backlog, do solo devs usually go through this entire process?
