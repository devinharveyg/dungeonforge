# Week 8 Evidence

## 1. BEFORE — the two problems

### Problem A: mode checks scattered across commands

```bash
grep -rn "hasLivingMonsters" src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/
```

**Paste it. How many command classes re-implement the same check?**

```
$ grep -rn "hasLivingMonsters" src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/
src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/CommandParser.java:172:        if (room.hasLivingMonsters()) {
src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/DropCommand.java:21:        if (room().hasLivingMonsters()) {
src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/MoveCommand.java:19:        if (room().hasLivingMonsters()) {
src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/TakeCommand.java:13:        if (room().hasLivingMonsters()) {

```

**Play a turn: start a fight, then type `north`. Paste what happens:**

```

=========================================
  version 0.7.0   seed 20260818

  Type 'help' for what you can do. You are carrying an hourglass -- 'use hourglass' rewinds a turn.
  [L1R0] Level 1: Crypt
  "Burial niches line the walls. Most are empty. Most."
  Exits: north


[HP 80/80] > 

help
[HP 80/80] > 
  Available: north, south, down, attack, take, drop, use, loot, undo, look, inventory, status, quests, history, help, quit
  Aliases: {n=north, s=south, d=down, descend=down, a=attack, kill=attack, hit=attack, get=take, t=take, quaff=use, drink=use, z=undo, l=look, i=inventory, inv=inventory, q=quests, ?=help, exit=quit}

north
[HP 80/80] > 
  You go north.
  ACHIEVEMENT: Cornered -- Force an enemy to change tactics
  Ghoul changes tactics: idle -> hunting.
  Ghoul hits you for 2.

hit
[HP 78/80] > 
  You hit Ghoul for 10.
  Ghoul changes tactics: hunting -> enraged.
  Ghoul hits you for 3.

north
[HP 75/80] > 
  You cannot walk away with enemies still standing.

quit
[HP 75/80] > 
  You lay down your pack.

  Delver  HP 75/80  ATK 10  DEF 3  Gold 0  XP 0  Carry 60.0kg
  Actions this session: 6   |   undo stack depth: 2
```

**Now type `help` during that fight. Does it list `north`?** ____
**Should it?**


### Problem B: the monster lifecycle as a string plus conditionals

```bash
grep -n "getStateName" src/main/java/dungeonforge/core/Combat.java
```

**Paste it. Which three methods branch on the state name?**

```
$ grep -n "getStateName" src/main/java/dungeonforge/core/Combat.java
65:        String current = m.getStateName();
109:        String state = m.getStateName();
147:        if (m.getStateName().equals("enraged")) {
```

**Answer before you refactor:**

1. To add a "stunned" state, which methods must you edit?

2. Reading `updateMonsterState()`, which states can follow `enraged`? How long did it take you
   to be sure?

3. What stops `setStateName("dancing")` from compiling?


## 2. AFTER — US-6.1 and US-6.2

**Paste `help` in Exploring and in Combat, side by side:**

```

```

**Paste an attempt to move during combat:**

```

```

**Paste the grep proving the guards are gone:**

```bash
grep -rn "hasLivingMonsters" src/main/java/dungeonforge/commands/
```

```

```

**Paste entering and leaving the pack, and the prompt in each mode:**

```

```

## 3. AFTER — US-6.3

**Paste the grep proving `Combat` no longer knows any state name:**

```bash
grep -n "getStateName\|\"enraged\"\|\"idle\"" src/main/java/dungeonforge/core/Combat.java
```

```

```

**Paste a fight showing a monster moving through its lifecycle:**

```

```

## 4. AFTER — US-6.4

**Paste the test output (or a demo) showing a healer that becomes aggressive when enraged:**

```

```

**In one sentence: which one changed the other, and could it have gone the other way?**


## 5. Tests and CI

**`mvn test` summary:**

```

```

**Green CI URL:**

## 6. Sprint review — one sentence

> What can the project do now that it could not do last week?
